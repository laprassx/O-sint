*Recon-ng** is a powerful, open-source web reconnaissance framework designed for information gathering and vulnerability scanning. It is often used in the initial stages of penetration testing, allowing hackers and security researchers to collect intelligence about a target website, domain, or network through automated methods. Recon-ng is similar in design to Metasploit, but it is specifically focused on **reconnaissance**.

Let’s go through the **details** of **Recon-ng**, how to use it, and a step-by-step guide for beginners.

## What is Recon-ng?

Recon-ng provides a modular interface to automate tasks like gathering information about domains, subdomains, users, email addresses, IP addresses, and much more. The framework is written in Python and has a command-line interface (CLI) similar to **Metasploit**, but it focuses on reconnaissance.

### Key Features of Recon-ng:
1. **Modules**: It has many pre-built modules for tasks like WHOIS lookups, DNS lookups, geolocation, social media gathering, etc.
2. **API Integration**: Recon-ng supports various APIs (like Shodan, Censys, FullContact) to gather more detailed information from external sources.
3. **Workspaces**: Similar to **projects** in Metasploit, you can work in different **workspaces** for different targets.
4. **Reports**: Recon-ng allows you to generate reports in various formats like JSON and HTML to document your findings.

  - Make sure you have **Python3** and **pip3** installed:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    ```

2. **Install Recon-ng**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng.git
  cd recon-ng
  sudo python3 setup.py install
  ```

### Installation on Windows:
1. **Install Python**: Ensure you have **Python 3** installed from the official website.
2. **Install Recon-ng**:
  - Open **Command Prompt** and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng.git
    cd recon-ng
    python setup.py install
    ```

## Recon-ng Commands & Usage

Once installed, Recon-ng operates in a **Metasploit-like** fashion. You enter a command-line shell and can run different modules.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Using Recon-ng:

#### Step 1: **Start Recon-ng**

To launch **Recon-ng**, type the following command in your terminal:
```bash
recon-ng
```

You will see a prompt similar to:
```bash
[recon-ng][default] >
```

#### Step 2: **Create a Workspace**

Workspaces help you keep track of your information-gathering process for different targets. Creating a workspace for a new target is highly recommended:
```bash
workspace create myworkspace
```

Switch to your workspace:
```bash
workspace select myworkspace
```

#### Step 3: **Modules in Recon-ng**

Recon-ng is built around modules that perform specific tasks. You can list all available modules using:
```bash
show modules
```

You will see different categories of modules, such as:
- **Recon modules** (e.g., `recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts`)
- **Reporting modules** (e.g., `reporting/list`)
- **API modules** (e.g., `recon/contacts-contacts/fullcontact`)

#### Step 4: **Add a Target Domain**

You’ll need to specify a target (domain or IP) to use with most modules. Add a domain like this:
```bash
add domains example.com
```

You can view the domains or other data you’ve added by typing:
```bash
show domains
```

#### Step 5: **Use Modules**

You can load a specific module to perform an operation. For example, if you want to perform a brute-force attack to find subdomains, you can use the `brute_hosts` module:
```bash
use recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts
```

Set the domain you want to target:
```bash
set SOURCE example.com
```

Execute the module:
```bash
run
```

You’ll now see a list of subdomains discovered by the brute force attack.

#### Step 6: **Use APIs for More Data**

Recon-ng can integrate with external APIs (like Shodan, Censys, or Whois). To use these, you first need to configure the **API keys**.

1. **View available keys**:
  ```bash
  keys list
  ```

2. **Add a key** (replace `SHODAN_API_KEY` with your actual API key):
  ```bash
  keys add shodan_api SHODAN_API_KEY
  ```

3. **Use the API module**:
  ```bash
  use recon/netblocks-hosts/shodan_net
  set source 1.1.1.0/24
  run
  ```

#### Step 7: **Generate Reports**

Once you've gathered data, you can export it in different formats (CSV, JSON, HTML). To export as an HTML report:
1. Load the **reporting** module:
  ```bash
  use reporting/html
  ```

2. Set the filename:
  ```bash
  set FILENAME /path/to/report.html
  ```

3. Run the report generation:
  ```bash
  run
  ```

### Popular Recon-ng Modules

Here’s a list of commonly used **Recon-ng** modules:

1. **recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts**: Brute force subdomain enumeration.
2. **recon/domains-hosts/enum_dns**: DNS enumeration.
3. **recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget**: Uses the Hackertarget API to find subdomains.
4. **recon/contacts-contacts/fullcontact**: Gathers information using the FullContact API.
5. **recon/profiles-profiles/github**: Gathers information about GitHub profiles related to the domain.
6. **recon/hosts-hosts/shodan_ip**: Gathers information about IP addresses using the Shodan API.

---

### Example Workflow

Here’s an example of how you might use **Recon-ng** in a typical reconnaissance task:

1. **Create a workspace**:
  ```bash
  workspace create example
  ```

2. **Add a target domain**:
  ```bash
  add domains example.com
  ```

3. **Gather subdomains**:
  ```bash
  use recon/domains-hosts/brute_hosts
  set source example.com
  run
  ```

4. **Get IP addresses for the domain**:
  ```bash
  use recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget
  set source example.com
  run
  ```

5. **Get more info using APIs (e.g., Shodan)**:
  ```bash
  keys add shodan_api YOUR_API_KEY
  use recon/hosts-hosts/shodan_ip
  set source <target-IP>
  run
  ```

6. **Generate a report**:
  ```bash
  use reporting/html
  set filename /path/to/report.html
  run
  ```
