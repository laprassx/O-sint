# Osint [WORK IN PROGRESS]
# **Welcome to the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) repository!**

OSINT refers to the practice of gathering and analyzing publicly available information from various sources.
Unlike traditional intelligence, OSINT relies on data that can be legally accessed and collected from open sources such as websites, social media, news articles, public records, and more.
This process can involve a wide range of techniques to extract, aggregate, and interpret information in ways that provide actionable insights.


## How OSINT is Used:

1. Cybersecurity: Organizations use OSINT to identify vulnerabilities, monitor threats, and assess risk exposure from publicly available information.

2. Investigations: Law enforcement, private investigators, and journalists use OSINT to track down individuals, discover hidden connections, and gather background information.

3. Threat Intelligence: Analysts monitor open sources to detect early warnings of cyberattacks, security incidents, or malicious actors.

4. Business Intelligence: Companies leverage OSINT to conduct market research, analyze competitors, and track industry trends.

This repository aims to provide tools, resources, and techniques for leveraging OSINT efficiently. Whether you are a cybersecurity professional, a researcher, or an investigator, this collection will help streamline your OSINT efforts.
